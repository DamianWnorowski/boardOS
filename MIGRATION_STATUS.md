## Current Status: ‚ùå NOT APPLIED

The multi-day scheduling migration has not been applied yet. This migration is **CRITICAL** for enabling:

## How to Apply the Migration

### Quick Method (Recommended)
1. **Open Supabase SQL Editor**

```bash
npm run test:migration
```

This will verify that:
- ‚úÖ schedule_date column exists in jobs table

### New Tables
- `schedules` - Multi-day schedule management
- `schedule_templates` - Reusable job templates
- `resource_availability` - Track when resources are available
- `recurring_job_patterns` - Define recurring job rules

### New Features Enabled

   DatabaseService.copyJobToDate(jobId, targetDate)
   DatabaseService.getResourceAvailability(resourceId, date)
   ```
