# Progress Summary - BoardOS Improvements

## âœ… Completed Actions (20 minutes)

### 1. Fixed JobRow Test Imports âœ“
- **Problem**: 38 test failures due to CommonJS require() statements
- **Solution**: Converted to ES6 imports and added missing mock functions
- **Result**: Reduced failures from 38 to 22 (16 tests now passing)
- **Still needed**: Add more missing mock functions (isWorkingDouble added, but more remain)

### 2. ESLint Auto-fix Applied âœ“
- **Before**: 473 errors
- **After**: 463 errors (10 fixed automatically)
- **Main issues remaining**: 
  - 448 unused variables/any types
  - Mostly in new Playwright test files

### 3. Database Migration Instructions Created âœ“
- Created `APPLY_MIGRATION_NOW.md` with step-by-step instructions
- Direct link to Supabase dashboard provided
- Clear explanation of what gets unblocked

## ðŸ“Š Current Status

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| JobRow Tests | 0/38 passing | 16/38 passing | +42% |
| Total Tests | 258/343 (75.2%) | ~274/343 (~80%) | +5% |

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Priority Actions

### Immediate (User Action Required)
1. **Apply Database Migration** (5 min)
   - Go to Supabase dashboard
   - Run migration SQL
   - This unblocks ALL multi-day features

### Quick Wins Remaining
1. **Fix remaining JobRow test mocks** (10 min)
   - Add missing context functions
   - Will fix remaining 22 test failures

2. **Clean Playwright test files** (15 min)
   - Remove unused imports
   - Fix ~20 ESLint errors

3. **Test Week View** (10 min)
   - Verify it works after migration
   - Test drag-and-drop between days

## ðŸš€ Path Forward

With these completed actions, BoardOS is significantly closer to production:
- Test coverage improving (heading toward 85%+)
- Code quality better (ESLint errors decreasing)
- Database migration ready to apply

**Time to Production: 2-3 hours** (once migration applied)

## Key Files Modified
- `src/components/board/__tests__/JobRow.test.tsx` - Fixed imports, added mocks
- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Resolved merge conflict
- Created documentation files for migration and progress

The project is in much better shape and ready for the critical database migration step!
