# BoardOS Development Session Summary
**Date**: August 26-27, 2025
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Multi-Day Scheduling System Implementation

## 🎯 Session Goals Achieved

### Phase 1: Navigation & Foundation ✅
1. **Fixed Print Button** - Now triggers browser print dialog with proper formatting
2. **Fixed Export Button** - Generates PDF with jsPDF, includes all job details
3. **Created Debug Panel** - Professional debugging tool (Ctrl+Shift+D)
4. **Database Migration** - Complete schema for multi-day support ready

### Phase 2: Multi-Day Features ✅
1. **Week View Component** - Full 7-day display with navigation
2. **View Mode Toggle** - Day/Week/Month switcher in navbar
3. **SchedulerContext Updates** - Added viewMode state and methods
4. **DatabaseService Methods** - Date-based operations for multi-day queries

### Phase 3: Code Quality ✅
1. **Fixed ESLint Errors** - Reduced by ~70%
2. **Removed Dead Code** - Cleaned up unused functions and imports
3. **TypeScript Improvements** - Added proper types for new features

## 📁 Files Created

### New Components
- `src/components/board/WeekView.tsx` - Week view component
- `src/components/debug/DebugPanel.tsx` - Debug panel
- `src/services/ExportService.ts` - PDF export service
- `src/styles/print.css` - Print stylesheet

### Database
- `supabase/migrations/20250826_add_schedule_support.sql` - Multi-day schema
- `DATABASE_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step migration guide

## 🔧 Files Modified

### Core Updates
- `src/context/SchedulerContext.tsx` - Added viewMode support
- `src/services/DatabaseService.ts` - Added date-based methods
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added scheduleDate fields
- `src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` - Added view toggle & button handlers
- `src/components/layout/SchedulerLayout.tsx` - Integrated WeekView
- `src/App.tsx` - Added DebugPanel

### Code Cleanup
- `src/components/board/JobRow.tsx` - Fixed linting errors
- `src/components/board/JobColumn.tsx` - Removed unused code

## 🚀 Current Status

### What's Working
- ✅ Day view (original functionality)
- ✅ Week view (shows current jobs on today only)
- ✅ Print functionality
- ✅ PDF export
- ✅ Debug panel
- ✅ View mode switching
- ✅ All existing drag-and-drop features

### What Needs Database Migration
- 📅 Jobs on different dates
- 📅 Copy jobs between days
- 📅 Recurring jobs
- 📅 Resource availability tracking

## 🔑 Key Decisions Made

1. **Week View First** - Prioritized week view over month view as more practical
2. **Migration Manual** - Created instructions for manual migration vs auto-apply
3. **Debug Panel** - Added comprehensive debugging vs simple console logs
4. **Print Stylesheet** - Separate CSS file vs inline styles

## 📊 Metrics

- **Lines of Code Added**: ~1,500
- **Components Created**: 3 major
- **Methods Added**: 5 database methods
- **Linting Errors Fixed**: ~20
- **Test Coverage**: Existing tests maintained

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Next Session

### CRITICAL: Database Migration Required
Before multi-day features work fully:
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run migration from `supabase/migrations/20250826_add_schedule_support.sql`
4. Verify tables created successfully

### Quick Start Commands
```bash
# Start development
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test

# Check linting
npm run lint

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Ctrl+Shift+D** - Toggle debug panel
- **Ctrl+P** - Print (browser default)

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities

### Immediate (If migration applied)
1. Test multi-day job creation
2. Implement job copying between days
3. Add date indicators to jobs

### Short Term
1. Calendar widget in sidebar
2. Job templates system
3. Recurring jobs feature

### Medium Term
1. Resource availability tracking
2. Month view implementation
3. Bulk operations for multiple days

### Long Term
1. Authentication system
2. Team collaboration features
3. Mobile app improvements

## 💡 Technical Debt to Address

1. **Remaining ESLint warnings** - Non-critical but should clean up
2. **Test coverage** - Add tests for new components
3. **Performance** - Consider virtual scrolling for month view
4. **Types** - Replace remaining `any` types

## 🐛 Known Issues

1. **Week view shows jobs only on today** - Requires migration
2. **Month view disabled** - Not yet implemented
3. **HMR warnings** - SchedulerContext causes page reloads
4. **Empty object destructuring** - In JobRow.tsx (cosmetic)

## 📝 Documentation Updates

- Updated `CLAUDE.md` with new features
- Created `DATABASE_MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- Created this session summary

### Productivity Highlights
- Completed 7 major todos
- Fixed critical navigation issues
- Implemented comprehensive week view
- Maintained app stability throughout
