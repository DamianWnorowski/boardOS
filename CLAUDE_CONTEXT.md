# BoardOS Project Status - Test Fixes Applied
*Updated: 2025-08-28 19:25*

## 🎯 CRITICAL NEXT STEP
**Apply Equipment RLS Policy Fix:**
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/eqbgcfdoyndocuomntdx/sql/new
2. Paste and run `equipment_rls_fix.sql` content
3. This will fix 7 integration test failures

## 📊 CURRENT PROGRESS

### ✅ COMPLETED FIXES
1. **ResourceCard Null Reference**: Fixed lines 321 & 326 with null checks
2. **Database Migration**: Applied and tested successfully
3. **Claude Session Management**: Full system deployed and working
4. **ScrewmanSelectorModal State Warning**: Fixed render-time state updates

### 🔧 TEST STATUS IMPROVEMENT
- **AssignmentCard Tests**: 29 passing / 12 failing (was worse)
- **Overall**: Reduced from 85 total failures to ~60
- **Null errors**: Eliminated the major crash causing 20+ test failures

### ⚠️ REMAINING BLOCKERS

#### 1. RLS Policy Issue (7 integration tests)
- **Error**: "new row violates row-level security policy for table 'equipment'"
- **Solution Ready**: `equipment_rls_fix.sql` created
- **Impact**: Blocks all integration tests

#### 2. Test Expectation Mismatches
- UI text expectations don't match implementation
- CSS class expectations missing
- Modal behavior differences

#### 3. Magnet Attachment Logic  
- Laborer → Paver attachment failing
- Rule lookup not finding correct permissions

## 📈 NEXT PRIORITIES

### Immediate (Manual)
1. **Apply RLS fix** - User must paste SQL in Supabase dashboard
2. Re-run tests to see integration tests pass

### Code Fixes (After RLS)
1. Update test expectations to match current UI text
2. Fix magnet interaction rules for laborer attachments
3. Review and fix remaining AssignmentCard test failures
